# Treasure Hoard (Campaign Forge Plugin)

This module generates **scalable treasure** from a single creature's pockets up to a **national treasury** or **legendary dragon hoard**.

It produces:
- Coins (CP/SP/EP/GP/PP)
- Gems & jewels
- Art objects
- Commodities (trade goods)
- Magic items
- Scrolls / written magic
- Relics / symbols
- Storage containers
- Complications, hooks, and dangers

Exports:
- `hoard.md` (GM-friendly summary)
- `hoard.json` (structured data for later use)

Notes:
- Value is expressed in **gp** for convenience and can be re-skinned to your system.
- Coin weight assumes **50 coins = 1 lb**.
- All tables are local JSON files under `tables/` and are safe to expand.
